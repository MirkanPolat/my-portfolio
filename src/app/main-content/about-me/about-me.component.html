      <h4>WHO'S MIRKAN?</h4>
      <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm Mirkan Polat a motivated frontend developer with a clear goal: to build digital products that are not only functional but also user-friendly and visually engaging.
        <br><br>
        My strength lies not just in technical understanding, but in the ability to solve real-world problems with well-thought-out solutions. For me, programming is not an end in itself, but a tool to turn complex requirements into tangible results.
        <br><br>
        Although my journey into the IT world is relatively recent, it comes with qualities that can't be taught: curiosity, perseverance, and a strong drive to grow every day. I work meticulously, think in solutions, and stay focused â€“ especially when things get challenging.
        <br><br>
        I'm not looking for a temporary stop, but a long-term opportunity in frontend development where I can not only contribute, but actively shape the outcome.
    </p>
      <p>Let's build software that truly makes a difference together!</p>
